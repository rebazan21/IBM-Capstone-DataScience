## Context:

Nowadays, spatial launches are very popular because of the advancement of technology and the reduction of costs.
SpaceX, a big company in this industry, has reduced dramatically its launch cost because they reuse the first stage. 
That is why is important to determine if a launch landing will be successful or not.

It is necessary to find the main variables that determine the launch success. 
But, which are they, how to find them and how to predict the result of a future launch?

## Summary of methodologies
This project start from the data collection using get_request, Web Scraping and then wrangling the data.
Then, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was done for compute for statistical metrics.
Later, some charts and plots were displayed to easily detect patterns in the data.
Finally, Machine Learning techniques were used in order to predict the result of a next launch.

## Summary of all results
About the results, it was discovered that the launch site and payload mass and booster used have a strong relationship with the target variable, i.e. the success of the launch landing.
Finally, we can find that there are some algorithms that have high accuracy classifying a future launch landing, but the model Decision Trees fits best the data.
